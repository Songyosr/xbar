# XBAR 🍸📊  
**Not Your Normal Bar** — Interactive Statistics Applets for the Curious Mind  

---

🚧 **This is a “to-be” project** 🚧  
Nothing’s on tap yet — we’re still mixing the perfect statistical cocktails.  
Check back soon for a menu of interactive, visual-first applets that raise the bar on learning stats.

## 🧠 What Will XBAR Be?  
A collection of **lightweight, embeddable React applets** that bring statistical ideas to life.  
Think: smooth animations, clean visuals, and the ability to poke and prod the math until it clicks.  

Planned specials:  
- 📈 **Sampling Distribution Lab** – watch the CLT in action  
- 🎯 **Confidence Interval Builder** – see coverage and miscoverage live  
- 🎲 **p-Value Explorer** – explore Type I/II error and power  
- 📏 **Effect Size Studio** – visualize Cohen’s d and overlaps  
- 🔍 **Regression Sandbox** – manipulate slope, intercept, and outliers  
- 🧮 **Bayes Intuition Board** – play with priors and posteriors

## 🍹 Why "XBAR"?  
In stats, **x̄** means *sample mean*.  
Here, it also means:  
- We’re **raising the bar** on stats learning  
- Definitely **not your average bar**  
- A **mean** place to hang out

## 🎨 Planned Style  
- **Minimalist**: white background, navy lines, orange highlights  
- **Responsive**: mobile → desktop with no scroll  
- **Accessible**: keyboard nav, ARIA labels, color + shape cues  
- **Smooth**: purposeful animations powered by Framer Motion
